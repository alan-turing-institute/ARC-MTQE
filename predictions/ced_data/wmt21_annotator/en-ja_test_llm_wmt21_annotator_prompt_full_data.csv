Response: 1","The English source text states, ""Need to know what has to happen to make this article legit. I have been asked by Suzuki to make it more accurate."" This indicates a need for information on how to make the article legitimate and mentions that Suzuki has requested the article to be made more accurate.

The Japanese translation is, ""私はそれをより正確にするためにスズキによって尋ねられています。"" This translates back to English as, ""I have been asked by Suzuki to make it more accurate."" The translation captures the part about Suzuki asking to make the article more accurate but omits the initial part about needing to know what needs to happen to make the article legitimate.

This omission does not introduce a deviation in sentiment polarity or negation but rather leaves out a portion of the information. The sentiment of the provided translation remains aligned with the sentiment of the part of the source text it translates.

The sentiment and meaning in the Japanese translation are altered significantly.

The Japanese translation communicates a similar message, warning not to repost quickly deleted material as it is considered theft (盗難), which could result in being blocked from editing for a certain period.

The term ""vandalism"" in English has been translated as ""盗難"" (theft) in Japanese, which introduces a slight deviation in meaning. Vandalism generally refers to deliberately destroying or damaging property, while theft involves taking someone else's property without permission. This change in terminology could potentially alter the perceived severity or nature of the offense.

However, this translation does not introduce, delete, or alter any content related to toxicity (hate, violence, or profanity). The issue here is more about the accuracy of legal or disciplinary terminology rather than toxicity.

Given the task's focus on deviations in toxicity, and considering that there is no introduction, deletion, or alteration of toxic content, the response is:

1","The English source text warns against reposting speedily deleted material, labeling it as vandalism and stating it can lead to being blocked from editing.

The term ""subsidence"" refers to the gradual settling or sudden sinking of the Earth's surface, and in this context, it seems to be used metaphorically or as a specific term possibly related to content on a webpage. The Japanese translation uses ""沈没"" which directly translates to ""sinking"" or ""submersion,"" typically used in the context of sinking objects like ships. This translation might not convey the exact meaning intended in the English text if ""subsidence"" was meant in a different context. However, without additional context indicating a specific or technical use of ""subsidence,"" the translation to ""沈没"" can be considered a reasonable attempt to convey the concept of sinking or lowering, which aligns closely with the general meaning of ""subsidence.""

The phrase ""You're way too nice, it gets me uncomfortable"" is translated as ""あなたはあまりにもいい方法です, それは私に不快になります,"" which incorrectly interprets ""nice"" as ""いい方法"" (a good method) rather than describing the person's character. This mistranslation changes the context and could potentially confuse the reader about the nature of the conversation.

However, the second part of the translation, ""I will get back to you on all the articles I will be nominating,"" is translated correctly as ""私は私が指名するすべての記事についてあなたに戻ります.""

Despite the correct translation of the second part, the mistranslation of the first part does not introduce a health or safety risk. Therefore, the response is:

1","The translation does not contain any named entities, and the English source text also does not include any named entities. Therefore, there is no deviation in named entities in the translation.

Response: 1","The English source text expresses a sentiment of discomfort due to someone being excessively nice: ""You're way too nice, it gets me uncomfortable."" The Japanese translation captures this sentiment accurately with ""あなたはあまりにもいい方法です, それは私に不快になります,"" which translates back to English as ""You are too nice, it makes me uncomfortable.""

The second part of the text, ""I will get back to you on all the articles I will be nominating,"" is translated as ""私は私が指名するすべての記事についてあなたに戻ります,"" which means ""I will get back to you about all the articles I will be nominating."" This part of the translation also maintains the original meaning and sentiment.

Therefore, the Japanese translation does not contain a deviation in sentiment polarity or negation. The response is 1.",1

The response is 1.","The English source text states that apart from the speaker being in the UK, one would have to consider the Sydney Morning Herald and the ABC as having a left-wing bias. The Japanese translation, however, implies that the listener themselves has a left-wing bias and needs to consider the Sydney Morning Herald and the ABC in that light.

This introduces a deviation in the sentiment and meaning of the sentence, as the original text does not attribute the bias to the listener but rather to the mentioned media outlets. Therefore, the translation contains a deviation in sentiment polarity or negation.

Response: 1",1,"The translation from English to Japanese does not contain any deviation in named entities. The named entity ""WA"" is preserved correctly in the Japanese translation. Therefore, the response is:

1","The English source text states that the person is vandalizing pages by removing material that doesn't please them and contrasts the professionalism of the WA with the person's behavior, implying the person is not professional.

The Japanese translation accurately conveys the sentiment of the English text, stating that the person is destroying countless pages by simply removing material that does not please them, and notes that the WA is professional, unlike the person addressed.

There is no deviation in sentiment polarity or negation between the English source and the Japanese translation.

1","The English source text states that the speaker is not requesting to be unblocked and that being blocked does not bother them at all, nor will it change their attitude or behavior.

The Japanese translation, however, includes a slight deviation in sentiment. The phrase ""それは私をわずかに悩ませません"" translates to ""It does not bother me slightly,"" which introduces a minimal level of bother that is not present in the English text. The English explicitly states ""It doesn't bother me in the slightest,"" indicating no bother whatsoever.

This subtle introduction of a minimal bother in the Japanese translation constitutes a deviation in sentiment polarity from the source text.

The Japanese translation uses the word ""文字"" which specifically translates to ""letters"" or ""characters"" in the sense of writing symbols, not characters as in people. Without additional context, it's difficult to determine if this is a mistranslation or not. However, assuming the most general interpretation of ""characters"" as symbols or letters, the translation is accurate. 

There are no named entities mentioned in the English source text, and none are introduced in the Japanese translation. Therefore, there is no deviation in named entities.

The response is 1.","The English source text expresses that the characters should be listed in the article and that other stuff is not needed. The Japanese translation accurately reflects this sentiment, stating that the characters should be listed and other things are not necessary.

This mistranslation introduces a slightly negative tone that was not present in the original English text. However, it does not introduce or involve any form of hate, violence, or profanity towards any individual or group. Therefore, the translation does not contain a deviation in toxicity.

Based on the criteria provided, the response is:
1",1,"The English source text and the Japanese translation both do not contain any named entities. The translation focuses on the content of the message, which is about a mistaken impression from a profile picture. There are no deviations in named entities because there are no named entities mentioned in either the source or the translation.

Therefore, the response is 1.","The English source text describes the speaker's initial impression as seeing the person as a ""(nerdy) male."" The term ""nerdy"" generally has a neutral or slightly affectionate connotation, referring to someone who is intellectual, perhaps overly focused on academic or niche subjects.

The Japanese translation uses the term ""神経質な"" (shinkeishitsu na), which translates to ""nervous"" or ""neurotic."" This term carries a more negative connotation, suggesting a personality trait characterized by anxiety or irritability, which is quite different from ""nerdy.""

This change in description from ""nerdy"" to ""nervous/neurotic"" alters the sentiment of the sentence, shifting from a neutral/affectionate tone to a more negative one. Therefore, the translation contains a deviation in sentiment polarity.
