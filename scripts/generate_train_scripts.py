# PLACEHOLDER
# Following MS2, this script will create all the slurm files for a given experiment group / config file
# Might need slightly different code for regular training vs hyperparameter search, depending on
# how we want to specify the grid of hyperparameters
# They will get logged in a folder ./train_scripts/{experiment_group_name}
